% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost function and gradient for collaborative
%               filtering. Concretely, you should first implement the cost
%               function (without regularization) and make sure it is
%               matches our costs. After that, you should implement the 
%               gradient and use the checkCostFunction routine to check
%               that the gradient is correct. Finally, you should implement
%               regularization.
%
% Notes: X - num_movies  x num_features matrix of movie features
%        Theta - num_users  x num_features matrix of user features
%        Y - num_movies x num_users matrix of user ratings of movies
%        R - num_movies x num_users matrix, where R(i, j) = 1 if the 
%            i-th movie was rated by the j-th user
%
% You should set the following variables correctly:
%
%        X_grad - num_movies x num_features matrix, containing the 
%                 partial derivatives w.r.t. to each element of X
%        Theta_grad - num_users x num_features matrix, containing the 
%                     partial derivatives w.r.t. to each element of Theta
%

% We only want to use cost function when R is set.
% So, for a user take the trained theta and the trained movie feature x, and predict outcome.
% Compare to what was set with y, square.
% I wonder if we could do this first with a full matrix multiply, and then do a .* R.
% But there might be other ways to do sparse matrix compute.

predictions = X*Theta';
diff = predictions - Y;
ratedDiffOnly = diff.*R;
squaredError = ratedDiffOnly.^2;
J = sum(sum(squaredError/2));
